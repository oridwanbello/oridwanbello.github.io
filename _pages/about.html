        I am passionate about enhancing human and animal health by unlocking the
        full potential of the immune system. I apply bioinformatics and machine
        learning to deconvolute the complexity of the immune system and
        accelerate translational solutions for human and animal health. I also
        explore selective breeding strategies to enhance animal health and
        productivity. I earned my Ph.D. from the Department of Animal and Avian
        Sciences, University of Maryland, College Park, USA. Prior to that, I
        earned my bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Ibadan,
        Nigeria, in Animal Science and Animal Breeding & Genetics, respectively.

            >Dr. Li Ma</a

        and single-cell transcriptomics. We provided insights into TCR
        publicness and identified distinct cellular phenotypes associated with T
        cells expressing public TCRs.

        According to my Gallup assessment, my core strengths lie in relationship
        building and strategic thinking. Check out my

        Beyond my academic pursuits, my leisure time is spent engaging in
        diverse cognitive and recreational activities. Reading journal articles,
        science books, history books, and biographies is relaxing and
        intellectually stimulating for me. I enjoy playing football and table
        tennis for physical activity and friendly competition. Watching news and
        sports broadcasts keeps me entertained and informed about current
        events. I also engage in graphic design as an outlet for boundless
        imagination and creativity.
