        <strong>Hello!</strong> I am currently a
        <strong>Ph.D. candidate</strong> in the Department of Animal & Avian
        Sciences at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am passionate
        about enhancing human and animal health, and I am committed to a
        lifelong pursuit of unlocking the full potential of the immune system.
        My research focuses on ways to prime the immune system for
        <strong
            >better disease prevention (broad and specific) and treatment</strong
        >. I also explore <strong>selective breeding strategies</strong> to
        enhance animal health and productivity.

            >Dr. Li Ma</a
        >, investigated the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of
        <strong>public T cells</strong> in humans and animals. My research spans
        both the computational and biological domains â€” integrating
        <strong>DNA-Seq, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, GWAS, statistics</strong>,
        and <strong>machine learning</strong> to study immune responses and
        disease resistance in humans and animals.

        According to my Gallup assessment, my core strengths lie in relationship
        building and strategic thinking. Check out my

        Beyond my academic pursuits, my leisure time is spent engaging in
        diverse cognitive and recreational activities. Reading journal articles,
        science books, history books, and biographies is relaxing and
        intellectually stimulating for me. I enjoy playing football and table
        tennis for physical activity and friendly competition. Watching news and
        sports broadcasts keeps me entertained and informed about current
        events. I also engage in graphic design as an outlet for boundless
        imagination and creativity.
