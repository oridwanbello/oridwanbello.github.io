        I apply bioinformatics and machine learning to deconvolute the
        complexity of the immune system and accelerate translational solutions
        for human and animal health. I also explore selective breeding
        strategies to enhance animal health and productivity. I earned a Ph.D.
        in Animal Sciences from the University of Maryland, College Park, USA.
        Prior to that, I earned a bachelor's in Animal Science and a master's in
        Animal Breeding & Genetics from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria.

            >Dr. Li Ma</a
        >, explored the drivers of shared/public T cell receptors (TCRs). Public
        TCRs are identical TCR sequences shared across individuals at levels
        that challenge the paradigm of near-limitless TCR diversity. Using deep
        learning and single-cell transcriptomics, we provided insights into TCR
        publicness and identified heightened immune phenotypes associated with T
        cells expressing public TCRs.

        According to my Gallup assessment, my core strengths lie in relationship
        building and strategic thinking. Check out my

        Beyond my academic pursuits, my leisure time is spent engaging in
        diverse cognitive and recreational activities. Reading journal articles,
        science books, history books, and biographies is relaxing and
        intellectually stimulating for me. I enjoy playing football and table
        tennis for physical activity and friendly competition. Watching news and
        sports broadcasts keeps me entertained and informed about current
        events. I also engage in graphic design as an outlet for boundless
        imagination and creativity.
